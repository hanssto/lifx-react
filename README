React frontend for the LIFX API

This is a bit of an exploration project, so it's quite rough around the edges.
I don't own a light, so I'm just working from reading the docs, probably
missing details along the way.

See:
  https://api.developer.lifx.com/docs/introduction

For now, the server API is mocked in JavaScript on the client side in:
  app/scripts/backends.js:MemoryBackend.

The mock provides a locked set of data which is reloaded on each run. It's also
greatly simplified, supporting only parts of the functionality and, for example,
not handling authentication, rate limiting or concurrency in any particular way.

Running the app should be as straightforward as opening
  app/index.html
in a browser.

You may need to disable restrictions on doing XHR in the file system, e.g.:
  chromium-browser --allow-file-access-from-files


Plans, if I get around to it:
* A dummy API server implemented in Python. Have a stupid prototype in Flask.
* A JS backend which communicates with the above.
* Mange the JS dependencies with whatever is in fashion today.
* A proper implementation against the real API, if I ever buy one of these
  things.
